/*
Arithmetic number
Given three integers  'A' denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , 'C' denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer 'B'. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not.

Example 1:
Input: A = 1, B = 3, C = 2
Output: 1
Explaination: 3 is the second term of the 
sequence starting with 1 and having a common 
difference 2.

Example 2:
Input: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
Output: 0
Explaination: 2 is not present in the sequence.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
-109 â‰¤ A, B, C â‰¤ 109
